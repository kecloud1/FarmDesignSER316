> This simulator is dedicated to the HÃ¤ge family and to Onkel Christian and Tante Ute, hardworking German farmers and part of our extended family. Visit the family farm at their website www.familie-haege.de/ or on Instagram @biohof.haege

**Design Patterns**
 > The following are the design patterns that I plan on implements in my Farm Design Assignment. 

- Strategy Pattern: I used the strategy pattern to dynamically assign which product and animal makes. This implementation is used in the harvestProduct() method in the Animal.java class.

*Requirements fulfilled by pattern:*
- Animals are dynamically assigned a product using this pattern in the separate type of Animal classes (Cow.java, Pig.java, Chicken.java).
- Animal product (milk, wool, and so on) is replenished after every 2nd day. For example, if a sheep is sheared for its wool then the farmers must wait 2 cycles (day and night) to collect the wool again.
- Animal product are sold for different prices depending on the product they are assigned eg. bacon is worth 7 dollars, and eggs are worth 2 dollars.


- Observer Pattern: I used the observer pattern to observe the day/night cycles and dynamically update the life counter on animals to determine animal production age, product production, and when predators are out, when to harvest crops, etc.

*Requirements fulfilled by pattern:*
- The simulation should run on cycles. A cycle is considered to be of 2 parts - 1 day time and 1 night time.
- Animals live for 14 days unless killed by a predator or they become diseased. If killed by a predator they disappear in that same night, if they become diseased they have a chance to die in the next cycle (day and night), unless treated by a farmer. Animal affinities may help with fighting the disease.
- Animals have a natural life cycle just like in real life. They start as a baby where they cannot produce anything for the first 3 days (but may still be killed by predators and disease), and then after that they may produce until they die.
- Passive currency is earned with each new day (not night). This passive currency income is generated from selling crops or animal products, or both depending on your farm.


- Factory Pattern: I plan on using this pattern to dynamically create Animals on each farm. This will greatly simplify my main method, and negate the need for lengthy if/else statements.

*Requirements fulfilled by pattern:*
- Animal creation is handled entirely by the factory, with the exception of tests for purposes of testing correct animal creation. 
- Animals have a chance to be born every 4 cycles (must have at least 2 for the chance to occur). 
- Animals live for 14 days unless killed by a predator or they become diseased. If killed by a predator they disappear in that same night, if they become diseased they have a chance to die in the next cycle (day and night).
