**Design Patterns**
 > The following are the design patterns that I plan on implements in my Farm Design Assignment. 
- Strategy Pattern: I plan on using the strategy pattern to help control and dynamically alter the behavior of various types of farms and various types of farmers (I see this as farmers having different characteristsics, which in turn makes the more efficient at tending a different type of farm. Additionally, I will use this to manage various animal affinitites.
- Observer Pattern: To observe the day/night cycles and dynamically update the life counter on animals to determine animal production age, product production, and when predators are out, when to harvest crops, etc.
- Factory Pattern: I plan on using this pattern to dynamically create Farms, Farmers, and Animals on those farms. This will greatly simplify my main method, and negate the need for length if/else statements.
