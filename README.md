**Design Patterns**
 > The following are the design patterns that I plan on implements in my Farm Design Assignment. 

- Strategy Pattern: I used the strategy pattern to dynamically assign which product and animal makes. This implementation is used in the harvestProduct() method in the Animal.java class.

- Observer Pattern: I used the observer pattern to observe the day/night cycles and dynamically update the life counter on animals to determine animal production age, product production, and when predators are out, when to harvest crops, etc.

- Factory Pattern: I plan on using this pattern to dynamically create Animals on each farm. This will greatly simplify my main method, and negate the need for lengthy if/else statements.
